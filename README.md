# Housing_Case_Study_RFE
Prediction of House Prices and variable selection using Recursive Feature Elimination

Recursive feature elimination (RFE) is a feature selection method that fits a model and removes the weakest feature (or features) until the specified number of features is reached. ... RFE requires a specified number of features to keep, however it is often not known in advance how many features are valid.
